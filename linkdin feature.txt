Proud to be part of Masai School growth and commitment to delivering #ExtraordinaryImpact. 
I joined MS in 2021  and I tell you It has been a wonderful experience. 
What I learnt and learning in MS is extraordinary. I'll always be grateful to 
The Almighty and then MS for giving this life changing opportunity to 
a boy from a small village of Bihar to start his career on a big platform 
which he had never imagined. Thank you #MASAISCHOOL
